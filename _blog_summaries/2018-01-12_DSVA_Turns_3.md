On January 11th, 2015, the U.S. Digital Service launched at VA (DSVA). The mission was ambitious, but critical: to make it easier for Veterans to get the benefits they deserve. We could not be more honored to serve those who have sacrificed so much to protect our country, and every single person who joins our team does so because they want to advance this mission.
