Current government buying methods struggle to keep pace with fast-changing technology. This includes how the government purchases tools and services, and how it establishes contracts with vendors of all sizes to build technology. For instance, they often take an all or nothing approach, either meticulously defining every requirement or remaining unhelpfully vague about expected outcomes. On top of that, many contracts focus on how the work will be done (i.e. how many people will work on what how often, how they’ll report their progress, etc.) instead of what they will deliver in the end.
